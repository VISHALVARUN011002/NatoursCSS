🌲 Natours - Outdoors is where life happens

📖 About The Project

Natours is a landing page for a fictional nature tour agency. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate advanced CSS and Sass techniques without relying on external CSS frameworks like Bootstrap.

It features a modern, responsive design with complex animations, a custom grid system, and a modular architecture.

✨ Key Features

- 7-1 Sass Architecture: Modular file structure (Abstracts, Components, Layout, Pages, etc.) for maintainability.
- Custom Grid System: A lightweight, float-based grid built from scratch using Sass mixins.
- Advanced CSS Animations: Custom keyframe animations, hover effects, and transitions.
- "Checkbox Hack" Navigation: A pure CSS full-screen navigation overlay that functions without JavaScript logic (enhanced with a small JS snippet for UX).
- Responsive Design: Optimized for all device sizes using media queries ( @content manager).
- BEM Methodology: Block Element Modifier naming convention for clean, scalable HTML/CSS.
- Interactive UI: 3D rotating cards, form animations, and modal popups.

🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML5 - Semantic markup.
- CSS3 - Custom properties, 3D transforms, clip-paths.
- Sass (SCSS) - Variables, mixins, nesting, and modular functions.
- JavaScript - Minimal usage (only for smooth scrolling and closing the mobile menu).
